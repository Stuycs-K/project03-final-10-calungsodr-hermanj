### 2024-01-06 - Began host and player files
Spent 30 minutes of class time starting the host and player files. Wrote 
extended comments for the intended usage of the host file, began writing
function headers and planning out how the code will work.

Spent 40 minutes in classs starting access with semaphores and writing
question/answer files. Worked with joy on modifying headers for 
organization in the host file.

semaphore work and creating separate functions. I also left comments
regarding how to move forward.

### 2024-01-08 - Semaphores and signals
