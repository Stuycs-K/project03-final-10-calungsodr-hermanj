# Multiplayer Trivia Game

### GROUP NAME HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Raechel Grace Calungsod, Joy Herman
       
### Project Description:

Multiple users will be able to play a text-based multiplayer trivia game through the terminal. 
After the players compile and run the program, text on the screen (the “game host”) will ask how
many players wish to join the game. The host will then wait for the chosen amount of players to
join the game before welcoming the players and explaining game instructions. The host will 
display a number of question topics (History, Geography, Math, Science) for the game.  

Players will enter their chosen topic into the host screen, and the host will start asking questions 
of this topic in rounds. One person will provide an answer answer per question. One correct answer 
means one point added to that player's score. Whoever gets the most points wins! 

Points are displayed after questions run out or if a player types 'end' to end the game.
